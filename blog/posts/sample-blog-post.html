                    Classic horror films, often characterized by their psychological suspense, gothic atmospheres, and reliance on tension rather than gore, are experiencing a significant resurgence in popularity. Modern audiences are rediscovering the chilling narratives and iconic monsters that defined early cinema.

                    From the silent era's *Nosferatu* to the Universal Monsters series featuring *Dracula*, *Frankenstein*, and *The Wolf Man*, these films laid the groundwork for the genre. Their influence is evident in contemporary cinema, with many filmmakers drawing inspiration from their storytelling techniques and visual styles.

                    What makes these timeless scares so enduring? Perhaps it's their focus on existential fears, the unknown, and the darker aspects of human nature. They often reflect societal anxieties of their time, making them surprisingly relevant even today. The lack of overt special effects forced creators to rely on strong narratives, compelling characters, and innovative cinematography to create fear, lessons that still resonate with film enthusiasts.
